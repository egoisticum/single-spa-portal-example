Guys, we are using single-spa last more then month, and we really like it at my company.
So, if you need some help with examples (in the beginning later on maybe with other code parts) we can jump in.
Also can jump in in contribution procedures so we can involve more guys here and support more frameworks.
What we have ready to use for this repo:
1. VueRouter
2. Redux in Vue so single-spa can become more attractive for vuejs developers.
